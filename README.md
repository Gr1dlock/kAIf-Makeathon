# TUM.ai Makeathon - kAIf Team

## Description

**Challenge Name:** Proactive Smoking Prevention

**Challenge Track:** Social Impact

**Challenge Setter:** Anant Nawalgaria (Google)

### Status Quo
People often smoke in areas where they aren’t supposed to smoke: i.e. petrol stations and other areas. However either in most of these areas this goes  unchecked, due to lack of manpower. And even with human intervention, it is often too late: which is relevant especially in areas with fire hazard

### Challenge
Proactive predictive Smoking alarm system which using a live video feed which alerts the organizers of the venue before people start smoking. Could work on 
multiple people at the same time and has to account for lighting conditions/viewing angles etc. One dataset that could be used to generate the  positive examples could be  the imagenet dataset after filtering for “smoking” or other filters
